    <h1 class="h2">Cell Culture + Seeding for HEK293 Transfection with Lipofectamine&trade; 2000 reagent</h1>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>6-well plate</li>
      <li>DMEM</li>
      <li>Proliferative HEK293 cells</li>
      <li>0.25% Trypsin solution</li>
      <li>Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)</li>
      <li>Stripette</li>
      <li>Stripette tips</li>
      <li>Centrifuge tubes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>1. Wash HEK293s with 0.08ml cm<sup>-2</sup> PBS.
    </p>
    <div class="note"> <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Gently pipette PBS onto side of vessel, not directly onto cells, to prevent washing cells off.
      </div>
    <p>2. Add 0.08ml cm<sup>-2</sup> of trypsin to the vessel. Incubate for 3-5 minutes (37&deg;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) until cells are fully detached from the vessel. </p>
    <div class="note"> <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> To check if cells are detached, use a low-magnification light microscope and gently shake the vessel. Detached cells will move about.
      </div>
    <p>3. Add 0.08ml cm<sup>-2</sup> of DMEM to the vessel to neutralise the trypsin.</p>
    <p>4. Transfer cell suspension to a centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 300 x <i>g</i> for 5 minutes to pellet cells.</p>
    <p>5. Aspirate and discard supernatant from centrifuge tube.</p>
    <p>6. Resuspend cell pellet in 1ml DMEM by gently pipetting up and down.</p>
    <p>7. Perform a cell count.</p>
    <div class="note"> <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"> 
    </i> There are multiple ways to perform a cell count. The simplest is using a hemocytometer. Ensure cell suspension is well-mixed throughout this protocol for consistent counts.
      <ul class="list3">
      <li>1. Dilute cell suspension by 50X as a guideline dilution for estimating cell concentration.</li>
      <li>2. Dispense 10&mu;l of diluted cell suspension into hemocytometer.</li>
      <li>3. Calculate average number of HEK293 cells per square of the hemocytometer based on at least 4 squares worth of cells.</li>
      <li>4. Make another dilution so that there are 30-70 cells per hemocytometer square. If the count is already in that range, skip this step.</li>
      <li>5. Multiply the cells per square by the dilution factor, then by 10000, to determine the concentration of cells in your cell suspension (per ml).</li>
      <li>6. If cell counts between both dilutions are similar, you can calculate their average (as in the example) for a final cell count. If they are quite different, use the cell count which had more cells per square (count 2 in the example).</li>
    </ul>
      Example calculation:
      <div class="container">
      <div class="card2a">
        <center>
        <img src="images/Cell count.jpg" alt="Cell count" width="80%">
      </center>
      </div>
      </div>
    </div>
      
    <p>8. Make up a mixture of cell suspension and DMEM sufficient to fill at least 2 wells of a 6 well plate, each with enough cells to be 70-90% confluent on the day of transfection.</p>
    <div class="note"> <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"> 
      </i> Example calculation:
      <div class="container">
        <div class="card2a">
          <center>
          <img src="images/Cell seeding.jpg" alt="Cell seeding" width="80%">
        </center>
        </div>
        </div>
      <br>
      To scale up the number of wells, each well (of a 6-well plate) requires 1.5ml DMEM and cell suspension total. Multiply by x number of wells instead of the 2 used in this example.
    </div>
  <p>9. Dispense 1.5ml of your DMEM and cell suspension mixture per well of a 6-well plate. Label the plate and incubate in a humidified atmosphere overnight (37&deg;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>).</p>
    <div class="note"> <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"> 
      </i> Ensure cell suspension is well mixed by pipetting up and down. Remember that additional wells will produce extra transfected cell lines that can be difficult to maintain at the same time.
