      <h2 class="h2">Choosing Restriction Enzymes</h2>
      <p>To effectively analyse your plasmid, you must select restriction enzymes that cut it in multiple locations, determine your expected results from using those enzymes, then run DNA electrophoresis to identify your plasmid relative to your expected results.</p>
      <p>1. Pick 2 restriction enzymes with at least 1 cut site on your plasmid. These should be checked thoroughly as some restriction enzymes recognise multiple cut sites.
      </p>

          <img src="images/cute site.jpg" alt="Plasmid map with cut sites" style="width:100%">
          <p class="legend"> <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Example plasmid map with singular cut sites highlighted in red and blue. Linear DNA fragments produced by use of both enzymes are shown in dark blue and green.
          </p>
            <p class="legend"> Restriction enzymes used for these cut sites are Thermofisher Anza&trade; brand: Eco32I (#IVGN0266) recognises EcoRV and XmaJI (#IVGN0154) recognises AvrII.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>2. Calculate the size of DNA bands you expect your restriction enzymes to produce.
      </p>
      <p>The number of cut sites each enzyme has determines the number of bands it will produce - a restriction enzyme with 1 cut site will produce 1 band, 2 cut sites will produce 2 bands...
      </p>

        </div>
      </div>
<p>3. Pick a DNA ladder with the resolution to distinguish your expected fragments.
</p>
      <div class="note"> <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> For this example, a ladder with high resolution around 1-15kbp would be ideal. 
      </div>
     <p>
  4. Using a diagram with your DNA ladder along the side, draw out the expected results from running your DNA fragments.</p>

      <a id="expectedresults">
      <p>4. You now know your expected results from digestion and running of your DNA plasmid using agarose gel electrophoresis. Compare these to your actual results to verify the identity of your DNA plasmid. </p>
      </a>
      <div class="note"> <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> It may be a good idea to use an enzyme with 2+ cut sites - more fragments can be easier to visualise and effectively identify more sites around the entire plasmid.
